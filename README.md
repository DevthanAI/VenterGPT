# VenterGPT

Implementation of kaparthy's nanoGPT to make an angry GPT.

## Disclaimer

I do not own the model, the model is owned by OpenAI and the implementation is owned by karpathy. I just made it angry.

## Why Jupyter Notebook?

I did experiment with the model in a python file locally and ran it with CPU and mps (as recommended by the original repository). However, this was still very slow locally. I wanted to speed up the process as well as not make my poor macbook suffer. So I decided to use Google Colab with premium GPU runtime. This only took a few minutes (referring to the shakespeare dataset).

## How to use

1. Open the ipynb file in Google Colab and run it.
2. Make sure the runtime is set to GPU (better if it is premium GPU).
3. If you encounter any errors while running it, please refer to the comments made in each block.
